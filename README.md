**Trend-Demand forecasting:**

Using real-time data, forecasting fast fashion trends' demand on our platform, ensuring accurate predictions with shorter timeframes for production and procurement adjustments.

**Two main models used:**

**1. XGBoost Regressor:**
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm known for its performance in regression tasks. It works by building an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, optimizing for predictive accuracy.

**Key Features and Benefits:**
Handling Complex Relationships: XGBoost can capture non-linear relationships between features and target variables, which is beneficial in fashion trend forecasting where trends can be influenced by multiple factors.

Regularization: Helps prevent overfitting by penalizing complex models, ensuring generalization to new data.

Performance: It's computationally efficient and scales well with large datasets, making it suitable for real-time forecasting applications.

**2. Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
MSE is a common metric used to evaluate regression models, including those used in fashion trend forecasting.

**Importance in Fashion Trend Forecasting:**

Quantitative Evaluation: MSE quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

Interpretability: It provides a straightforward measure of prediction accuracy, crucial for assessing how well the model predicts future fashion trends' demand.

Decision Support: Enables stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding production, procurement, and inventory management based on the model's performance.
